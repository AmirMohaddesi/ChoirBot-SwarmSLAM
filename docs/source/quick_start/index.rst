Containment in Leader-Follower Networks for single-integrator systems
==================================================================================

In this page, we show how to run a basic distributed cooperative robotics scenario in **ChoiRbot**.
Specifically, we consider a containment problem in leader-follower networks as described in [MeEg11]_.


Prerequisites
----------------------------

We assume a working installation of **ChoiRbot** and RVIZ is available
(see the :ref:`installation page <installation>`).
Moreover, we assume the reader to be familiar with the basic concepts
of ROS 2 launch files and Python.


Maths of the problem
----------------------------

We consider a team of :math:`N` robots moving 
in the :math:`(x,y)` plane.
Each robot is modelled as single-integrator dynamical system

.. math::

   \dot{x}_i(t) = u_i(t),

where for all :math:`i \in \{1, \ldots, N\}`, :math:`x_i \in \mathbb{R}^2` is the
:math:`i`-th system state (i.e., position) and :math:`u_i \in \mathbb{R}^2`
is the :math:`i`-th system input (i.e., velocity).
We assume the robots communicate according to a given
undirected graph :math:`\mathcal{G} = (\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})`, where
:math:`\mathcal{V} = \{1, \ldots, N\}` is the set of robots and
:math:`\mathcal{E} \subset \mathcal{V} \times \mathcal{V}` is the set of
edges. If :math:`(i,j) \in \mathcal{E}`, then also :math:`(j,i) \in \mathcal{E}`
and robots :math:`i` and :math:`j` can send information to each other.
The set of neighbors of each agent :math:`i` is denoted by
:math:`\mathcal{N}_i = \{j \in \mathcal{V} \mid (i,j) \in \mathcal{E}\}`.

Robots are partitioned in two groups, namely leaders and followers. 
The goal for the followers is to converge to the convex hull of the leadersâ€™ positions. 
To this end, the robots implement the dynamics

.. math::

  \begin{split}
  \dot{x}_i(t) &= 0 \hspace{4cm} & \text{(leaders)},
  \\
  \dot{x}_i(t) &= \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}_i} (x_j(t) - x_t(t)) & \text{(followers)}.
  \end{split}


Simulation Launch File
--------------------------------
The launch file to run the simulation is 

.. literalinclude:: ../../../choirbot_examples/launch/containment.launch.py
  :language: Python
