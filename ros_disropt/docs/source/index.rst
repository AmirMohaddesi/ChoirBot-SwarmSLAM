Welcome to ChoiRbot!
=======================================

**ChoiRbot** is a ROS 2 package developed by `Andrea Testa <https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/a.testa/en>`_, `Andrea Camisa <https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/a.camisa/en>`_ and `Giuseppe Notarsefano <https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/giuseppe.notarstefano/en>`_  within the excellence research program ERC in the project `OPT4SMART <http://opt4smart.dei.unibo.it/index.html>`_. The aim of **ChoiRbot** is to provide a comprehensive framework to easily simulate and run experiments on teams of cooperating robots, with a particular focus on peer-to-peer networks
of robotic agents without a central coordinator.

The package is already equipped with basic trajectory planning, control and dynamics integration utilities, so that you can just start to test your algorithm on basic robot models as quadrotors, unicycle-like vehicles and single-integrator dynamical systems. 
Please refer to :ref:`api_documentation` for a detailed description of the package functionalities.
